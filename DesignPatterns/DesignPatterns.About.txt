There are three types of Design Patterns:
	Creational - Creational patterns concern the process of object creation
	Structural - Structural patterns deal with the composition of classes or objects
	Behavioral - Behavioral patterns characterize the ways in which classes or objects interact and distribute responsibility

Design Patterns:
	Creational - classe(s): Factory Method
		[-] Abstract Factory (aka "Kit")
		[-] Builder
		[] Prototype
		[] Singleton
	Structural - classe(s): Adapter
		[-] Adapter (aka "Wrapper")
		[] Bridge
		[] Composite
		[-] Decorator (aka "Wrapper")
		[] Facade
		[] Flyweight
		[-] Proxy (aka "Surrogate")
	Behavioral - classe(s): Interpreter, Template Method
		[] Chain of Responsibility
		[] Command
		[] Iterator
		[] Mediator
		[] Memento
		[-] Observer
		[] State
		[] Strategy
		[] Visitor
